# Hierarchical Modeling and Skeletal Subspace Deformation
I made starter code work on my computer using [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPl5mThO9so&ab_channel=MetaphysicsComputing).
This code should work on any Windows PC (maybe).

I haven't done any additional tasks, but I plan to do more in my own implementation with a more modern API.

## Based on
1) [Hierarchical modeling and scene graphs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdhpViedm0g&list=PLQ3UicqQtfNuBjzJ-KEWmG1yjiRMXYKhh&index=5&ab_channel=JustinSolomon) lecture.
2) [Computer animation terminology, skinning and SSD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vcDnHXLLCg&list=PLQ3UicqQtfNuBjzJ-KEWmG1yjiRMXYKhh&index=6&ab_channel=JustinSolomon) lecture.
3) [Assignment description.](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-837-computer-graphics-fall-2012/resources/mit6_837f12_assn2/)

I learned quite a lot from this assignment, it was interesting to learn that normals can be generated on the fly using cross product, but thats just a small part. Justin Solomon lectures are really intersting. Thanks to him for making them public ðŸ˜˜.
